## Title: Simple Calculator using Python Flask, HTML, and CSS

## Description:

This is a simple calculator web application built using Python Flask, HTML, and CSS. The application allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user interacts with the calculator through a web interface with two pages: index.html and results.html.

The index.html page contains a simple form with two input fields and a dropdown menu to select the desired arithmetic operation. When the user submits the form, the application processes the inputs and redirects to the results.html page, which displays the result of the operation.

The application is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, and uses Jinja2 templating engine to render HTML templates. The styling of the application is done using CSS.

To run the application, you need to install Python 3 and the Flask package. You can then clone this repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the app.py file using the command python app.py. The application will start running on http://localhost:5000/.

Additionally, I tested the calculator app in Postman
